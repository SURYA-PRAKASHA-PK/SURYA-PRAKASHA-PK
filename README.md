💡 I’m a curious data practitioner, passionate about building **data-driven solutions** that extract value from raw information. With hands-on experience in **SQL**, **Python**, and **machine learning**, I specialize in turning messy data into structured insights.

🚀 I'm currently upskilling in:
- Building **end-to-end data pipelines**
- Applying **statistical and ML models** for business decisions
- Using **deep learning** for advanced image and text tasks
